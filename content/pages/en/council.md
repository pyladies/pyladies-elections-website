</div>

<br>

After a [public request for comment period](https://github.com/pyladies/global-organizing/issues/11) in 2019, PyLadies created the current format for global PyLadies governance:

- A global council selected through a public election and an application process
- Open source project teams open to all PyLadies members


### Council Membership

- The council will have 9 seats.
- 6 seats selected via public election, with a term of **2 years**.
- 3 seats appointed via application, with a term of **1 year**.
- No one country of residence will account for more than 33% of the council during a cohort.
- There are no caps on the number of terms a council member can serve.

The structure of the Council is subject to change based on recommendations and input from the PyLadies Global Council and the broader PyLadies community.
